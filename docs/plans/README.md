# Plans and evidence index

[unreal-migration-plan.md](unreal-migration-plan.md) is the **single canonical root plan** for current scope, all feature-parity milestones and implementation/verification status. `unreal-development-plan.md` preserves old links as a pointer only. The owner has confirmed `Warhammer_40k_UI_arcade` as the Python UI baseline.

Current finite increment: **P1a Windows standalone package and non-visible checks**, on `codex/p1-windows-standalone` in a new bounded PR. Runtime data/assets, reproducible build/cook/stage, packaged launcher selection, focused offscreen checks and one real-Core action are included. Visible package/input tests, clean-machine proof, Linux and new gameplay/profile/viewer/recovery features are outside this PR. The owner is using the screen; visible tests and GUI interaction are on HOLD.

[PR #3](https://github.com/SobolGaming/Warhammer_40k_UI_unreal/pull/3) merged as `2f9e0c11cee65f531be2d4eebe8e7e29532ebf64`. [Closed history through r156](unreal-migration-plan-through-r156.md) preserves its implementation/checklists. Its bounded [manual launcher](evidence/2026-10-24-live-core-camera-visible.md), [native input](evidence/2026-10-24-live-core-native-camera-input.md) and [cancellation](evidence/2026-10-24-live-core-cancellation.md) results remain valid only within their recorded source and workflow limits. The earlier manual F failure, real OS-switch/teardown gaps and native Linux UNTESTED status remain explicit.
